/* the position property 
 This property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky).

    1. static: default value. The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect.
    2. relative: The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to itself based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements; thus, the space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if position were static.
    3. absolute: The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor, if any; otherwise, it is placed relative to the initial containing block. Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.
    4. fixed: The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport, except when one of its ancestors has a transform, perspective, or filter property set to something other than none (see the CSS Transforms Spec), in which case that ancestor is used as the containing block.
    5. sticky: The element is treated as relative until it crosses a specified threshold, at which point it is treated as fixed.
